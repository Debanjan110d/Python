name=input("What is your name?")

print(f"Good Morning {name}",)#To use Curly brackets " {} " we must use the  " f " to make the string as f-string
#This Thing added in latest python


#In old days it was something like this

print("Good Morning",name)

#or

print("Good Morning "+name)

#or

print("Good Morning "+str(name))

#or

print("Good Morning "+name+ " ")
#But now we can use f-string to make it more easy and readable
